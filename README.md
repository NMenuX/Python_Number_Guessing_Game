# Python_Number_Guessing_Game
This code is relatively simple, but it can be extended to make the game more challenging or interesting. For example, you could:

Increase the number of guesses allowed. [Line 47]
/ Allow the user to choose the range of numbers to guess from.[Line 5]
/ Keep track of the user's best score and display it at the end of the game.
