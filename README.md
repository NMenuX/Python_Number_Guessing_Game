# Python_Number_Guessing_Game
This code is relatively simple, but it can be extended to make the game more challenging or interesting. For example, you could:

Increase the number of guesses allowed.
Allow the user to choose the range of numbers to guess from.
Keep track of the user's best score and display it at the end of the game.
Add different difficulty levels.
